Q. What is the purpose of Z-Index?

Z-index in CSS is used to control the stacking order of HTML elements. It allows us to decide which element appears on top of or below other elements. In other words, we can manage the layout order using the z-index. The element with a higher z-index will appear on top of elements with lower z-index values

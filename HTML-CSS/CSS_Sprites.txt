CSS sprites:
A CSS sprite is a technique used to optimize web page performance by combining multiple images into a single image file. This reduces the number of HTTP requests needed to load individual images, which can significantly improve load times and performance. Once the combined image (sprite) is loaded, CSS is used to display specific parts of the image by adjusting the background-position property, effectively showing only the required portion of the larger image in different sections of the webpage. This method is particularly useful for small images like icons or buttons that are reused frequently across a site. These images can be used for hover effects, list styles and other small icons.

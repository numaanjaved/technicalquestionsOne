Important: The !important keyword in CSS is used to give the highest priority to a specific style. For example, if you have an h1 tag with inline styles, styles defined in a <style> tag, and styles in a separate CSS file, the browser might be confused about which style to apply. In such cases, the !important keyword can be used to ensure a particular style is applied, overriding other styles.

Usage:
h1 {
  font-size: 10px !important;
}

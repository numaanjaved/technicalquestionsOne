Positions in CSS:

Position absolute: An element with position: absolute moves relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not just its parent).
syntax:
div {
  position: absolute;
}

Position relative: An element with position: relative moves relative to its own original position.
syntax:
div {
  position: relative;
}

Position sticky: An element with position: sticky toggles between relative and fixed based on the user's scroll position, becoming fixed when it reaches a specified scroll point.
syntax:
div {
  position: sticky;
}

Position static: Position static is the default position of elements in CSS, and it will not move when using top, bottom, left, or right.
syntax:
div {
  position: static;
}
